## My process

### Built with

- React
- React Router DOM v6.6
- Material UI 5
- Framer Motion
- Vite
- React Hooks

### What I learned

How to efficiently use React Hooks and useMemo and Context providers and React Router.

### Continued development

Use of Redux for state management

### Useful resources

- [React Router](https://www.reactrouter.com) - This helped me in how to implement efficiently React Router DOM. Their training material was spot on
- [UseMemo & useCallback](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/usememo-and-usecallback/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand useMemo and useCallback efficiently. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
